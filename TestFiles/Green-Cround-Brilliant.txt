The green-crowned brilliant (Heliodoxa jacula) is a large, robust hummingbird that is a resident breeder in the highlands from Costa Rica to western Ecuador. It is also known as the green-fronted brilliant.[2]

The male green-crowned brilliant is 13 cm (5.1 in) long and weighs 9.5 g (0.34 oz). It is mainly bronze-green with a glittering green crown, forehead, throat and breast. It has a white spot behind the eye, a small violet-blue throat patch, white thighs, and a deeply forked blue-black tail.[3]

The female is 12 cm (4.7 in) long and weighs 8 g (0.28 oz). She differs from the male in that she has green-spotted white underparts, a white spot behind the eye and a white stripe below the eye, and a white-cornered shallowly-forked black tail. Young birds resemble the adult of the same sex, but are duller, bronze-tinged below and have buff throats.[3]

The green-crowned brilliant has a loud squeaky kyew call.[3]
