Composition
The artist is surrounded by a dark shadow as he holds a smoking cigarette in his hand. John Ravenal compares the painting's dramatic lighting to that of a stage.[2]: 88  Sue Prideaux writes that "Munch appears from the cigarette smoke like a genie from a bottle".[3]: 157  The cigarette, which the art historian Patricia Berman calls "a nexus for marginal social identities in the 1890s", was a symbol for "deviancy" and the "social dissolution" between class and gender boundaries. Thus, its inclusion in the self-portrait rejects traditional values and associates Munch with bohemianism and decadence. Berman also believes that the artist's depiction of himself with a "thin, dissolving body" and "sallow skin" employs physical decay to challenge social and health norms.[4]: 627, 644 

History
The painting was exhibited at Blomqvist's in Oslo during the autumn of 1895, along with Munch's other works including the 1893 version of The Scream, the 1894–1895 version of Madonna, and Vampire.[4]: 627  The self-portrait was originally intended to be exhibited as a pair of "twin 'wedding portraits'" with Munch's portrait of his supposed lover Dagny Juel. However, Juel's father asked Munch to take down his daughter's portrait before the exhibition, which Munch did. Self-Portrait with Cigarette was purchased that year by the National Gallery, now part of the National Museum of Norway.[3]: 147, 157 [1]

The self-portrait's exhibition led to controversy surrounding Munch's mental health. Johan Scharffenberg, then a medical student, suggested the painting to be a manifestation of Munch's amorality and mental degeneration; Scharffenberg diagnosed the artist as a sick and corrupting influence on Norwegian youth.[4]: 629  Berman identifies this and other criticism against the painting's potential danger towards society to be motivated by influential thinkers such as Max Nordau.[4]: 6 

From 1908 to 1909, Munch produced a lithograph also titled Self-Portrait with Cigarette.[5]: 29  He also made a photographic reproduction of the painting some time between 1907 and 1909.[3]: 256 

From February to May 2006, the self-portrait and 86 other paintings by Munch were featured at the Museum of Modern Art for the first 21st-century retrospective of Munch's career, titled Edvard Munch: The Modern Life of the Soul.[6]
